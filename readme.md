## Ecommerce Backend Project with RESTful APIs - Applying SRP and OCP in Node.js and Express.js



### Overview
This GitHub repository houses a comprehensive backend solution for an ecommerce application. Built using Node.js and Express.js, it leverages the principles of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open-Closed Principle (OCP) to ensure a modular, extensible, and maintainable codebase.

### Key Features
- **RESTful APIs:** The project provides a collection of well-designed RESTful APIs that enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend, allowing for efficient management of ecommerce operations.

- **Modular Design:** The codebase is organized using a modular design approach, where each component is responsible for a specific functionality or feature. This adherence to SRP ensures that each module has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** The project follows the OCP principle, which means the codebase is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows for easy scalability and future enhancements without modifying existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.

- **Node.js and Express.js:** The project is developed using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime, and Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. These technologies provide a robust and efficient foundation for building scalable and high-performance ecommerce backends.
